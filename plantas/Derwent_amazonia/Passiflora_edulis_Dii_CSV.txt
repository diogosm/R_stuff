The shells were chopped into small pieces less than 10 mm in length and placed in container. Hot water (65-75 degrees C) was added to the container to immerse the chopped shells completely. The mixture was stirred occasionally during the first hour and then left to soak overnight. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate passed through a column of non-ionic polymeric resin to absorb phenolic and other organic compounds. Distilled water was passed through the column to wash out sugars and other polar components. The absorbed compounds were then eluted from the column with methanol and the eluant concentrated under reduced pressure to give a dark concentrate. The concentrate was freeze-dried to give the passion fruit extract as a dark red powder. 		A96 (Medical, dental, veterinary, cosmetic.);  B04 (Natural products and polymers.

 LU Y;  WATSON R	KEMIN FOODS LC (KEMI-Non-standard);  IND RES LTD LLC (IRES-C);  SOUTHWEST SCI EDITING & CONSULTING LLC (SWSC-Non-standard);  IND RES LTD (IRES-C);  SOUTHWEST SCI EDITING & CONSULTING LLC (SWSC-Non-standard)	2005778896	   NOVELTY - Preparation of passion fruit extract involves contacting passion fruit skin with water to provide an aqueous extract and a solid residue, contacting the aqueous extract with a polymeric matrix to adsorb one component from the aqueous extract, and eluting the composition from the matrix.    USE - For preventing hypertension and liver damage (claimed). The extract is used in nutraceutical, dietary supplement, pharmaceutical, functional food and beverages.    ADVANTAGE - The passion fruit skin extract has excellent blood pressure reducing effect, serum nitric oxide level reducing effect, platelet aggregation inhibitory effect and cardiovascular protecting action.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:    (1) passion fruit extract prepared by the above method;    (2) method of lowering blood pressure in humans, which involves administering the extract;    (3) method of lowering serum nitric oxide levels in mammal, which involves administering the extract; and    (4) method for preventing liver damage, which involves administering the extract. 	TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - ORGANIC CHEMISTRY - Preferred Solvent: The elution is performed using an organic solvent selected from ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, methanol, 1-propanol and acetone.Preferred Process: The method further involves washing the polymeric matrix with water after contacting with the aqueous extract and prior to the elution step.Preferred Components: The polymeric matrix is a non-ionic polymeric matrix resin. The passion fruit skin extract comprises catechin, cyanidine, edulilic acid, epicatechin, luteolin, phenyl pyruvic acid, quercetin and their glycosides, preferably edulilic acid. ACTIVITY - Hypotensive; Hepatotropic; Vasodilator; Anticoagulant; Cardiovascular-Gen.    Hypertensive patients were administered with passion fruit extract (2 mg/lb/day) for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, the average systolic blood pressure of 176.6plus minus4.9 mmHg of the patient was reduced significantly to 147.67plus minus4.4 mmHg. The average diastolic blood pressure of 103.27plus minus2.3 mmHg of the patient was reduced significantly to 78.67plus minus2.78 mmHg. Hence, concluded that the extract exhibited excellent hypotensive effect.    MECHANISM OF ACTION - Nitric-Oxide-Antagonist; LDL-Antagonist; Platelet-Aggregation-Inhibitor; Na-K-ATPase-Stimulator; Ca-ATPase-Stimulator.    In vitro studies showed that passion fruit extract increased human red blood cell membrane bound Na-K ATPase and Ca ATPase activity. RBC membrane bound Na-K pump ATPase had much higher activity when cultured with the extract at 0.25 mg/ml (increased by 102%), 1 mg/ml (increased by 107%) or 25 mg/ml (increased by 170%) than the control group. The extract at concentrations of 1 mg/ml and 2.5 mg/ml increased membrane bound Ca ATPase activity by 78% and 41%.    EXAMPLE - Passiflora edulis fruits were cut into halves and the juicy pulp removed to give empty shells of passion fruit skin. The shells were chopped into small pieces less than 10 mm in length and placed in a container. Hot water 65-75degreesC was added to the container to immerse the chopped shells completely. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate passed through a column of non-ionic polymeric resin to absorb phenolic and other organic compounds. Distilled water was passed through the column to wash out sugars and other polar components. The absorbed compounds were then eluted from the column with methanol and the eluant was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain a dark concentrate. The concentrate was freeze dried to obtain passion fruit extract as dark red powder. 		B04 (Natural products and polymers.

Also claimed is food contg. fruit juice of edible plant belonging to Passiflora which intensifies alpha brain wave.    The amt. of fruit juice of Passiflora in food is more than 5 wt. %. Examples of Passiflora are Passiflora edulis flavicarpa, Passiflora laurifolia and Passiflora edulis Sims, pref. Passiflora edulis flavicarpa. Passiflora is used directly, purified, or mixed with other substances such as saccharide, water, flavour, spices, herb or tea. The liq. or powdery Passiflora is also used as alpha brain wave potentiator in a form of liq., granules or tablets; or drinks, candies or jam. The amt. of liq. Passiflora is 10-50 wt. %, and that of powdery Passiflora is 10-80 wt. %.    USE -   The alpha brain wave potentiator or food contg. it removes stress and makes patients relaxed because alpha waves are intensified. The potentiator has good taste and fragrance, and easily administered. It does not cause any unfavourable daily life activities such as drowsiness, and can be administered repetitively without causing side effects.    In an example, fruit of Passiflora edulia flavicarpa was cut into two, and the content was pressed to give fruit juice (1000 g), to which NaOH was added to adjust pH at 3.9, and freeze-dried to obtain powder of Passiflora fruit juice (130 g). Thus obtains powder (10 g) was administered on 2 males (A and B) and 2 females (C and D), and brain wave, flicker test and stimulus reaction time were measured. The results showed that after 180 mins. of the admin., theta and beta waves of all subjects were decreased, whereas alpha waves (esp., alpha 1 and 2 waves) were intensified. The fruit juice did not influence reaction time even though it had slightly central nervous depressanti activity, which was so little that it did not interfere with the daily life activities.
